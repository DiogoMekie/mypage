# 💼 My Developer Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website — a place to share my journey, showcase my work,
and make it easy for people (and recruiters!) to get in touch.

## 🛠 How It's Made

**Tech used:**  
- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **GitHub API**
- **EmailJS**
- **tsParticles**
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**

This project was built from scratch with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS for design and layout. 
I implemented JavaScript logic to dynamically fetch and render my GitHub repositories into the Projects section using the GitHub REST API.

The Hero section features animated typing effects and rotating subtitles to make a strong visual impression,
while `tsParticles` adds some motion and fun. The contact form uses **EmailJS** to send messages directly to my inbox,
with real-time success/error feedback.

I focused on building a UI that is both aesthetic and user-friendly across devices,
while keeping the code modular and easy to maintain.

## 🚀 Optimizations

- Projects are fetched live from GitHub to avoid manual updates
- Contact form uses async communication with EmailJS (no backend required)
- Scroll animations were added for better UX without hurting performance
- Used semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO benefits

## ✨ What’s Next?

I’m planning to add:
- Better filtering or tagging system for projects
- A light/dark mode toggle
